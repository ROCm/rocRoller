         * Locking Rules
         * 
         * A scheduler has a number of streams which each will yield a sequence of instructions.
         * The job of the scheduler is to pick (i.e. schedule) the instruction from the beginning of one of the streams, and then repeat until there are no more streams with any instructions left.
         * 
         * - If a scheduler schedules an exclusive lock, it must continue to
         * select instructions from that same stream until that lock has been
         * unlocked.
         *   - That stream might include further lock/unlock instructions which
         * must occur in a last-in, first-out order, those should be treated
         * as a stack to track when the original lock has been unlocked.
         * 
         * - If a stream yields any kind of lock, it cannot yield a lower-ranked
         *   lock until it releases the higher-ranked lock.
         * - If a scheduler schedules a non-exclusive lock, it cannot schedule
         *   the same kind of lock from any other stream until that lock is
         *   released.
         *      Example:
         *          1. Stream 0 locks M0.
         *          2. Stream 1 locks VCC.
         *          3. Stream 0 tries to lock VCC.  It must wait until Stream 1 unlocks VCC.
         *          4. Stream 1 unlocks VCC.
         *          5. Stream 0 locks VCC.
         *          6. Stream 1 locks SCC.  Pull from Stream 1 until SCC is unlocked.
         *          7. Stream 0 locks SCC.  Pull from Stream 0 until SCC is unlocked.
         *          8. Stream 0 unlocks VCC.
         *          9. Stream 0 unlocks M0.
         * 
         * - If a scheduler schedules a non-exclusive lock, it cannot schedule a
         *   lower-ranked exclusive lock from any stream until that lock is
         *   released.
         *      Examples:
         *          - If stream 0 locks M0, and then we see stream 3 try to lock
         *            Branch, we can't pull from stream 3 until stream 0
         *            releases M0.
         *          - If stream 2 locks VCC, stream 1 can lock SCC.  We will
         *            then have to pull from stream 1 until SCC is released.
         *
